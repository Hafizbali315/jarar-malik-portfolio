		This text is displayed in front of the repeating image. That's because it's a
		<a href="//www.html.am/html-codes/image-codes/background-image-code.cfm">background image</a>, as opposed to a normal image that has
		been defined using normal <a href="//www.html.am/html-codes/image-codes/">image code</a>.
